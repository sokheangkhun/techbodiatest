# Techbodia Test
This is the project which I submit in Google form.

Contact me at Telegram [@sokheangkhun](https://t.me/sokheangkhun).

This project shows four ways how to validate IP addresses with the following methods' name `ValidateIpUsingSystemNet` `ValidateIpUsingRegularExpression` `ValidateIP1` and `ValidateIP2`.
They also have method's description and some comments which show what it does.

And it also include the first test I took in the first interview go by the method name `TestInFirstInterview`.

Thank you.
